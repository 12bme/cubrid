 * Lock-free Circular Queue

/* Lock-free Circular Queue is actually an array of entries, where the last
 * entry in the array is considered as preceding the first entry in the array.
 * The two ends of the queue are stored (head and tail). New entries are
 * "produced" at the end of the queue, while "consumers" will pop entries from
 * the head of the queue.
 *
 * The queue has a fixed maximum capacity. When there is no more room for new
 * entries, the push function will return false.
 *
 * The size for entry data must be fixed.
